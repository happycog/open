Our process largely follows the [Github Flow][1] pattern.

[1]:http://scottchacon.com/2011/08/31/github-flow.html

1. Work on master for hotfixes and non-breaking updates. This includes things like tweaking CSS and adjusting field templates. If you're adding an entire template, though, branch off so as not to affect other developers on the project.
    * If you work on a feature branch name it accordingly, but don't worry about extra specificity. Simply `homepage-updates` is fine, please don't nest branch names with `/`.
    * You may choose to work on a feature branch on this repository or a fork of the repository under your own user.

If you're working on a feature branch,

1. Commit and push your changes.
4. After pushing changes they will be automatically deployed.
5. After confirming your work, log into github.com and create a pull request to merge your feature branch into `master`.
6. Once your pull request has been merged into master, delete the feature branch from the Github UI.
